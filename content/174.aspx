                     Controlling high spin polarized currents is most important factor for spintronics devices. For this purpose, we have three strategies of new materials for high spin polarization. First is Co-based full-Heusler alloy (for example; Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl<sub>0.5</sub>Si<sub>0.5</sub>, Co<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>1-x</sub>Si, etc) of the highly spin polarized use it as electrode of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Full Heusler alloy electrode in MTJ and GMR devices are still promising material to control the high spin polarization, and importance of finding the new Heusler alloy is no doubt. Second strategy is using the half Heusler semiconductor (for example; LaAuPb, YAuBi etc), which has large spin-orbit interaction for controlling the spin polarized current by external fields. Third is a spin-filter devices using magnetic oxide materials (includes ferrite such as CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, -Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, BiFeCoO<sub>3</sub>, BiFeO<sub>3</sub>, etc.) as a barrier. Theoretically, ferromagnetic insulator as a barrier has possibility to control the high spin polarization. However, experimentally, high spin polarization is not successfully control at room temperature yet. Therefore, the goal of third strategy is control the high spin polarized current using the ferro(ferri) magnetic insulator at room temperature by preparing the high quality epitaxial barrier.
