                     In the extension period, we would like to focus on the interplay of exchange and spin-orbit interaction in advanced, Heusler-based materials. We will design new Heusler compounds with extremely large spin-orbit coupling, synthesize these compounds and perform the basic characterization.
                     <br />
                     The needed advanced spin and orbital resolved magnetization characterization by means of synchrotron radiation based methods will be done by the project of G.H. Fecher.

                        The goal of the project is the design and investigation of new compounds with extremely large spin-orbit coupling for potential applications in spintronic devices. Large spin-orbit coupling can be expected for Heusler alloys comprising high-Z elements.
