                     In this project, we aim to make systematic investigations for the Gilbert damping constants of Heusler alloys. Especially, study on the effects of presence of surface or interfaces in the thin film and multilayer systems including Heusler alloys are of great importance in viewpoint of the development of the MRAM, because the half-metallicity of the Heusler alloys may be strongly influenced by the inhomogeneties and the circumstances at the interfaces. Furthermore, since the Gilbert damping is originated from the spin-orbit interaction of the system, it is expected that the damping constant is related to the orbital moments, the magnetic anisotropy constants, the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In particular, the AHE reflects the strength of spin mixing at the Fermi level, which is also for the case of Gilbert damping. Therefore, in addition to the Gilbert damping itself, we focus on the relation between the Gilbert damping constants and the Hall conductivities of the Heusler alloys.
