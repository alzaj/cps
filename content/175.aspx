                     Our activity permanently implies theoretical ab-initio design of new materials and combinations potentially interesting within the framework of the ASPIMATT (half-metallic ferromagnets, semoconductors, topological insulators, materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy), computation of their properties (magnetic, spectroscopic, transport), together with the development of the corresponding computer codes. Based on the program developments during the last funding period (calculation of the DC transport within Kubo-Streda formalism), within the extension time we will focus on the design of the candidate compounds for the spin-torque transfer (STT) MRAM applications. Rather challenging requirements for these materials (low saturation magnetic moment, low Gilbert damping, high thermal stability, high magnetic anisotropy, high spin-polarization and good lattice match with MgO) make the theoretical ab-initio design in STT-MRAM field to be an efficient research tool. As we have shown recently, the important STT parameters can be tailored by adjustments of the composition within the family of tetragonal Heusler compounds, which is extremely large.
