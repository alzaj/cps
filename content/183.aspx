                     This project focuses on the preparation of half-metallic Heusler alloy film and GMR/TMR devices with Heusler electrodes on Silicon (Si) substrate in order to realize novel spintronic devices such as spin-transistor. One of the most promising methods for achieving efficient spin injection into semiconductors is to use half-metallic ferromagnets as spin injectors because of their high spin polarization. Among the various half-metallic ferromagnets, Heusler alloys are particularly promising as a spin injector because of its high spin polarization at RT. On the other hand, Si is considered to be a superior semiconductor owing to its long spin lifetime and overwhelming dominance in the semiconductor industry. However, the desired half-metallic magnetic property is usually lost at interfaces of half-metals and semiconductors. Theoretical investigations suggest that a Co<sub>2</sub>MnSi Heusler alloy/Si(001) thin film is thermodynamically stable and has a robust ferromagnetic metallic ground state. On the other hand, the interface between a Heusler alloy and Si(110) is predicted to be better for spin transport when injection is carried out via tunneling through a Schottky barrier. To verify this and develop an approach of spin injection from Heusler alloy into Si, it is necessary to determine the structural and ferromagnetic properties of Heusler films on Si. The goal of this project is to achieve highly polarized spin injection into silicon by optimization of fabrication conditions for Heusler alloy thin films.
