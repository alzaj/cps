	 In the extension period, the project will focus on the interplay of exchange and spin-orbit interaction in advanced, Heusler-based materials, this includes the extension of the spin and orbital resolved magnetization characterisation by means of synchrotron radiation based methods, especially X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) using soft X-rays.

		The following approaches are proposed:
		<br />
		The goal of the project is the investigation of new compounds with extremely large spin-orbit coupling for potential applications in spintronic devices exploiting the Rashba effect. Large spin-orbit coupling can be expected for Heusler alloys comprising high-Z elements.
